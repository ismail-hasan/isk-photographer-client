                <p className='mt-3 text-lg'>SQL is the programming language used to interface with relational database And NoSQL is a class of DBMs that are non-relational and generally do not use SQL.</p>
                <p className='mt-3 text-lg'>SQL has been around for over 40 years, so it is recognizable, documented, and widely-used. Safe and versatile, itâ€™s particularly well suited for complex queries. However, SQL restricts the user to working within a predefined tabular schema, and more care must be taken to organize and understand the data before it is used.</p>
                <p className='mt-3 text-lg'>The dynamic schemata of NoSQL databases allow representation of alternative structures, often alongside each other, encouraging greater flexibility. There is less emphasis on planning, greater freedom when adding new attributes or fields, and the possibility of varied syntax across databases. As a group, however, NoSQL languages lack the standard interface which SQL provides, so more complex queries can be difficult to execute.</p>

                <p className='mt-3 text-lg'> NodeJS receives multiple client requests and places them into EventQueue. NodeJS is built with the concept of event-driven architecture. NodeJS has its own EventLoop which is an infinite loop that receives requests and processes them</p>
